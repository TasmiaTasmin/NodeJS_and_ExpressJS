    * Topics:
        1. Execution context
            * 2 part
                1. memory component or variable environment
                2. code component or thread of execution

            * 2 phase
                1. Creation phase ( Memory creation phase )
                2. Execution phase ( Code execution phase )
        
        2. Call stack: To manage Global and Local execution contexts, JavaScript uses a stack which is called Call-Stack(execution context stack, program stack, control stack, runtime stack, machine stack).
		
		
		* hoisting: variables and functions assigns before the execution of code.
